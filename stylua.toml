# Lua is not a widely used programming language, and as of 2025 there is still
# no universally accepted, unopinionated style guide for it. Developers in the
# Neovim community often follow their own preferred conventions when writing
# plugins. For this reason, I created my own Stylua configuration, which may
# evolve over time. The main reasons behind my choices are:
#
#     1. A 4-space indentation style is common in many programming languages. It
#        helps readers understand code structure quickly and consistently.
#     2. A 100-column limit strikes a balance between narrow (80) and wide (120)
#        formats. Modern displays offer more horizontal space, and developers
#        often choose descriptive variable names over abbreviations, making a
#        wider limit practical.
#     3. Lua makes little distinction between single and double quotes. Single
#        quotes require fewer keystrokes, since you do not need to press Shift.
#     4. Removing unnecessary parentheses keeps Lua code cleaner and easier to
#        read.
